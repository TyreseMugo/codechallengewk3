This project is a simple Movie Ticket Purchasing application that allows users to view a list of available movies and purchase tickets for the selected movie. The app retrieves movie data from an external API and enables users to buy tickets, updating the ticket count accordingly. 

### Getting Started

To get started with the Movie Ticket Purchasing App, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Explore the list of available movies and their details.
4. Click the "Buy Ticket" button to purchase a ticket for a selected movie.
5. If tickets are at 0, it should show a notification that they are sold out.

### Code Overview

The `index.js` file contains the JavaScript code responsible for fetching movie data from the API and displaying it on the webpage. The code includes event listeners for the "Buy Ticket" button to handle ticket purchases and update the ticket count on the page. Error handling is also implemented to manage any errors that might occur during the data fetching process.
